# Description
# ShaperBox 3 Presets loading Automation Script
Since shaperbox 3.5 doesn't have multi import feature, it is needed to load presets manually. This script automates the process of loading presets from a directory.

# How to use
1. Install requirements.txt
2. Refer to [steps](/docs/steps.md)

Refer to [example_recorded_automation.json](example_recorded_automation.json) - **It depends on screen coords and screen dimentions**, so it's not universal !!!!

# Limitations
- Tested only on Linux with Bitwig and yabridge, and shaperbox 3.5.2
- Tested on FXP only. Potentially may be adjusted to FLP and FL Studio, but I don't have those and not sure it works on Linux (Constibutions are welcome)
